This code attempts to recover Kansas City Standard data from audio tape. It manages
with decent success on the small sample of tapes I have.

The utility expects an uncompressed wave file, 16 bits at 44 kHz (CD quality), mono.
You can also give it stereo and it will only use the first channel. You can easily
record the wave file with any audio editing program like Audacity.

There are two command line options:

-c # - tells osiwave to ignore the first # samples. This is useful if tape leader
noise or tone gets translated into garbage.

-d # - tells osiwave the size of the window to use for DC averaging. Playing with
this value can improve accuracy; it's a parameter for filtering the audio before
running the detection stage on it. The default is 96 and values between 64 and 256
are probably the most useful.

Have fun!
